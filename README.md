# Quantum-dot-laser-applications
This project is to apply quantum dot laser in microwave signal processing. 

1. microwave photonics filter simulation
   Include two classes: a. comb generatio; b. MWP filter response
2. comb shaping using waveshaper/functions include:
   a. Flatten comb
   b. Gaussian apodization
   c. Sampling
   d. Sinc for flat-top filter response
   f. Sinc^2 for triangular filter response
   e. Sinc**cos for flat-top bandpass filter
   g. Sinc^2**cos for triangular bandpass filter
